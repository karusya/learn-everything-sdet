# Basic Statistics

## Histogram

A **histogram** is a graphical representation of data that shows how values are distributed across ranges (bins).

It helps to:
- Visualize the shape of the data
- Identify skewness and spread
- Detect outliers or unusual patterns

Histograms are commonly used as a first step in data exploration.

## Data distributions

To approximate and understand real-world data, we often assume that data follows a **distribution**.

Commonly used distributions include:
- Normal distribution
- Exponential distribution

## What is a distribution?

A **distribution** is a graphical or mathematical description of how measurements are spread across possible values.

It answers questions such as:
- Which values occur most often?
- How spread out is the data?
- Is the data symmetric or skewed?

---

## Normal distribution

The **normal distribution** (also called the **Gaussian distribution**) has a:
- Bell-shaped curve
- Symmetric form around the center

Key properties:
- Most values cluster around the mean
- Mean, median, and mode are equal
- Extreme values are increasingly rare

This distribution is common in natural and measurement-based data.

## Exponential distribution

The **exponential distribution** is commonly used when estimating:
- Time between two events

Characteristics:
- Values are always positive
- Many small values, fewer large values
- Right-skewed shape

Typical use cases:
- Time until a system failure
- Time between customer arrivals
- Waiting times

## Mean, median, and mode

These are **measures of central tendency**.

### Mean
- The average of all values
- Calculated as the sum of values divided by the number of values
- Sensitive to outliers

### Median
- The middle value when data is ordered
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Useful for skewed distributions

### Mode
- The most frequently occurring value
- Can be one value, multiple values, or none

## Summary

- Histograms visualize how data is distributed
- Distributions describe patterns in measurements
- Normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped
- Exponential distribution models time between events
- Mean, median, and mode summarize central tendency
